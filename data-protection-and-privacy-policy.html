                subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively,
                “<strong>Stablecoin Labs</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”) respect the
                privacy of Personal Data and are committed to protecting
                Personal Data.  This Data Protection and Privacy Policy (this
                “<strong>Policy</strong>”) describes the policies and procedures
                Stablecoin Labs has implemented to protect Personal Data Processed by Stablecoin Labs
                in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws.  This Policy
                also describes how Stablecoin Labs collects, uses, and discloses Personal
                Data from your interactions with us, including when you visit
                Stablecoin Labs websites and other online platforms as well as your privacy
                rights.  This Policy does not apply to the Personal Data of
                Stablecoin Labs’s employees, contractors, or job applicants, which are
                subject to separate data protection policies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stablecoin Labs has voluntarily opted to apply the protections and
                obligations outlined in this Policy to all Data Subjects.
                 However, such protections and obligations may be beyond the
                legal requirements of the jurisdiction of certain Data Subjects.
                 Data Protection Laws vary widely across jurisdictions and while
                Stablecoin Labs will strive to meet this Policy for all Data Subjects, the
                Data Protection Laws for the Data Subject ultimately govern the
                protections conferred in the specific jurisdiction applicable to
                that Data Subject.  Additionally, there may be certain rights
                applicable to you for which we may provide separate notice
                informing you of your rights and how to adequately exercise
                them.

                in certain circumstances, a Data Subject may possess the right
                to:
              </p>
              <p>
                 • <em>Request access</em> to his or her Personal Data that Stablecoin Labs
                holds to check that it is accurately and lawfully being
                Processed.  Specifically, in some jurisdictions you may request
                confirmation that we Process your Personal Data and ask for: (i)
                a portable copy of the specific pieces of your Personal Data;
                (ii) a list of categories of Personal Data (and Sensitive

                 • <em>Request correction</em> of his or her Personal Data that
                Stablecoin Labs holds.  This enables Data Subjects to have any incomplete
                or inaccurate Personal Data be corrected, though Stablecoin Labs may need

                remove Personal Data where there is no legitimate purpose for
                the Processing of such Personal Data by Stablecoin Labs.  Stablecoin Labs may not
                always be able to comply with the request of erasure for
                specific legal reasons or other legitimate grounds, which will

                where Stablecoin Labs is relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
                third party) and he or she would like to object to the
                Processing because it impacts his or her fundamental rights and
                freedoms.
              </p>

                 • <em>Request restriction of Processing</em> of his or her
                Personal Data.  This enables Data Subjects to ask Stablecoin Labs to
                suspend Processing Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a)
                establishing the accuracy of Personal Data; (b) where Stablecoin Labs's use
                of Personal Data is unlawful, but there is no request of
                erasure; (c) where a Data Subject needs Stablecoin Labs to hold Personal
                Data even if retention is no longer required and it is needed to
                establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim; or (d) a Data
                Subject objects to Stablecoin Labs's use of Personal Data, but Stablecoin Labs needs
                to verify whether there are overriding legitimate grounds to use
                it.

                Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable

                You may designate an agent to submit requests on your behalf

                You will not generally have to pay a fee to access your Personal
                Data or to exercise any of the above rights.  However, Stablecoin Labs may
                charge a reasonable fee if the request is clearly unfounded or
                excessive. Stablecoin Labs will try to respond to all legitimate requests
                within thirty (30) days.  Occasionally, it may take Stablecoin Labs longer
                if the request is particularly complex.  Alternatively, Stablecoin Labs may
                refuse to comply with the request in certain circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stablecoin Labs hopes that it will be able to address any Data Subjects

                to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction.

              <p>
                Stablecoin Labs has implemented appropriate elements of privacy by design
                in conjunction with technical and physical safeguards designed
                to protect the security of Personal Data from unauthorized or
                unlawful Processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                In assessing the appropriate level of security as well as the
                risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
                freedoms of Data Subjects, Stablecoin Labs assesses the risks presented by
                the Processing of Personal Data.  Such risks may include, but
                are not limited to, any accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized
                destruction, loss, disclosure, alteration, or access to Personal
                Data Processed by or on behalf of Stablecoin Labs, or other factors that
                may impact Data Subject rights and freedoms.  Stablecoin Labs shall make
                reasonable attempts to ensure that any risks presented by the
                Processing of Personal Data are sufficiently mitigated by
                technological and/or organizational controls, including limited
                access of Personal Data utilizing access controls and password
                protections.  However, nobody can guarantee that data
                transmitted through or stored on the Internet will be 100%
                secure all the time.

              <p>
                For each Process, Stablecoin Labs shall maintain an inventory to capture
                the business function, purpose of Processing, categories of Data
                Subjects, Personal Data type, access, technical and
                organizational security measures, applicable Data Protection

                Personal Data inventory shall be reviewed on at least an annual

              <p>
                Stablecoin Labs has completed a risk assessment for each Process to
                identify any potentially high-risk areas to Data Subjects or the
                Processing of Personal Data.  A Process may be classified as
                high risk as a result of the Processing of (i) Special Category
                Data; (ii) a large volume of Personal Data; (iii) Personal Data
                using automated processing or profiling; or (iv) Personal Data
                using new internal technologies.  Controllers that engage in
                high-risk Processing shall conduct data protection impact
                assessments (DPIAs) for such Processes.  Stablecoin Labs has conducted a
                DPIA for each Process designated as high risk.  Such DPIAs
                outline the measures taken to address each identified risk to
                the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects and may be provided to
                supervisory authorities upon request.
